## Features

- **Categories**: Users can explore words by category.
- **Word Cards**: Each word card displays the word, its meaning, part of speech, and allows users to listen to the pronunciation.
- **Modals**: Clicking on the "When to Say" button opens a modal with additional information like the example and usage.
- **Word Pronunciation**: Integrated with the browser's speech synthesis API to pronounce words.
- **Dynamic Data**: The data for categories and words is fetched from external JSON files (`categories.json` and `product.json`).
